# C-data-Structures

A collection of data structures implemented in C, primarily intended for continued practice in C. I'm also considering adding less strictly data-structures concepts (smart pointers or a memory manager, for example), but haven't begun that yet. 

Currently Implmeneted:
ArrayList
BST

In Progress:
Blum Filter
HashSet

Planned:
HashMap
Self-Balancing BST (likely an AVL tree, possibly a red-black tree)
